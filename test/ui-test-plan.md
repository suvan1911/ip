# UI Test Plan

This file records console UI test cases for `LenZaBot`.

Focus:
- invalid input handling
- command parsing regressions
- a small number of happy-path checks around task creation and status changes

Each test case below includes:
- an aim
- the commands to enter
- the expected output for each command
- a JSON block used by `.opencode/skills/test-ui/run-ui-tests.ps1`
